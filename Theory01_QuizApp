Quiz App:
Create a new folder in file manager and open that folder in VSCode.
Firstly, in terminal create an virtual environment (env)
1) -> pip install virtualenv
2) -> python -m venv envQuiz
3) -> .\envQuiz\Scripts\Activate
------Activates the env

To check the downloaded packages in env,
-> pip freeze

Now, download the Django in current env by,
4) -> pip install django
-------django installed Successfully

Now, create the Django project by,
5) -> django-admin startproject QuizProj

Now, create App by,
6) -> cd QuizProj (root directory)
7) -> python manage.py startapp QuizApp

Now, we have to link both Project and App by,
8) QuizProj -> settings.py -> line:40---CODE---(1)
---------we have linked both project and App.

Now, we have to create web page in server by,
9) QuizAPP -> views.py -> line:1,4&5---CODE---(1)
And, we have to create a new file "urls.py" in "QuizApp" folder 
10) QuizApp -> urls.py -> line:1---CODE---(1)
11) QuizProj -> urls.py -> line:18&22---CODE---(1)
In terminal, -> python manage.py runserver, copy the LINK and paste in web server for output
--------------Output in server.

Now, we creating a models by,
12) QuizApp -> models.py -> line:4---CODE---(1)
After creating models, we have to migrate the models to create database by,
13) -> python manage.py makemigrations
    -> python manage.py migrate
----------migration Successfully completed.

Now, we have to create SuperUser by,
14) -> python manage.py createsuperuser
Then, it asks for username, email and password.
    -> username: SriPujar
    -> Email: srinivaspujar2001@gmail.com
    -> Password: Pujar@2818
--------------SuperUser created successfully

AND, we have to register the classes of models in "QuizApp" 'admin.py' by,
15) QuizApp -> admin.py -> line:2&4---CODE---(1)

By logging in server we can open it like,
16) open through -> LINK + /admin/              ---> http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
And fill the Credentials and LOGIN.
---------------And you will see the Table of all CLASSES in database.

Then, you have to fill the admin's CLASSES in server by,
17) you will find 3 database Models like -> Category, Question, Answer.
--Category -> +Add -> enter category name -> save
--Question -> +Add -> enter Question name -> save
--Answer -> +Add -> enter Answer name -> save
---------------------It stores in Database of admin panel.

Now, we will make this job easy by,
18) QuizApp -> admin.py -> ---CODE---(2)      (it helps to show the data(question and answer) in inline)
    QuizApp -> models.py -> ---CODE---(2)    (it helps to show the data(question and answer) NAME)

Now, we are creating an API by,
19) QuizApp -> views.py -> ---CODE---(2)
20) QuizApp -> models.py -> ---CODE---(3)

Now, we are creating the front end of the project by,
In QuizApp create a new folder "Templates", and create a new file "home.html" in that Templates.
21) QuizApp -> views.py -> ---CODE---(4) then,
QuizApp -> Templates -> home.html -> ---CODE---(1)
22) AND, QuizApp -> views.py -> ---CODE---(5)
23) AND, QuizApp -> views.py -> ---CODE---(6)
Then, we to register that in 
24) QuizApp -> urls.py -> ---CODE---(2)

Then, Create a new file "quiz.html" in "Templates" 
25) "Templates" -> quiz.html -> ---CODE---(1)(2)
26) AND, QuizApp -> views.py -> ---CODE---(7)
27) "Templates" -> quiz.html -> ---CODE---(3)

28) In QuizApp -> views.py -> ---CODE---(8)
29) "Templates" -> quiz.html -> ---CODE---(4)
