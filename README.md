# QuizApp_UsingDjango-and-Vue.JS
This Quiz App is built using Django (backend) and Vue.js (frontend). The Django backend manages APIs, question data, and category-based quiz logic. Users start on the home page, where they select a quiz category. On clicking Submit, Vue.js redirects them to the quiz page with that category.
